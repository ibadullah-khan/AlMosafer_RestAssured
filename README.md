# AlMosafer_RestAssured

**Framework Overview**
Framwork is based on Rest Assured, TestNG, Maven (for Build Management) and Allure Report (for Reporting)

Two APIs have been taken,

GET: /api/enigma/hotel/lookup

POST: /api/v3/flights/flight/get-fares-calender

Some highlighted concepts that have been used,
- Request and Response Specification in Rest Assured
- TestNG annotations
- Usage of Hamcrest library for basic response validation
- Usage of Constants and Utils
- Usage of config.properties
- Inheritence for Test Class
- Allure reporting enhanced reports can be generated by command (allure serve)


Note: Header "token" can be fetched from response, but as per instructions I have taken hardcoded from Network tab. So currently, there is no implementation of corelation concept.
